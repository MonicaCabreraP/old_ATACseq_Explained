:arrow_right: **What is ATACseq?** ATAC-seq stands for **A**ssay for **T**ransposase-**A**ccessible **C**hromatin with high-throughput **seq**uencing and is a method that relies on next-generation sequencing (NGS) library construction using the hyperactive transposase Tn5 for mapping chromatin accessibility.

:arrow_right: **How old is this technique?** The ATAC-seq method was first published in 2013 in the journal [Nature Methods by Jason Buenrostro]( ATACseq_Explained/References/Buenrostro_2013.pdf) in the labs of Howard Chang and William Greenleaf at Stanford University. 

:arrow_right: **What are the main advantages?** Compared to other techniques, such as FAIRE-Seq or DNase-Seq that investigate similar chromatin features, ATACseq uses lower number of cells for the assay and its a simple two-step experimental protocol.
